                            Three-Level Diode Clamped Multilevel Inverter with Photovoltaic System for Brushless DC Motor Drive Applications in Electric Vehicles</a></h2>
                    <p>Multilevel converters have become a crucial technology in medium voltage high power applications. Various multilevel inverter topologies have been adopted, with the diode-clamped inverters having improved torque ripple reduction and reduced capacitance requirement in three-phase inverters with a common DC bus for BLDC motor applications. In automotive vehicles, BLDC motor drives require torque ripple reduction and improved stator current flow. This paper introduces a proposed design that incorporates a PWM-controlled Diode clamped multilevel inverter(DCMLI) by fed BLDC motor to achieve this. A PWM-controlled bidirectional converter and boost converter are used to control power fed by the photovoltaic system. A battery is implemented to increase the vehicle's range and provide storage for excess power generated by PV panels.<br />
